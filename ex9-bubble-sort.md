Bubble Sort
As an exercise we want you to try to create a function that sorts a list of n integers in ascending order. 
You will use the sorting algorithm known as bubble sort. Use the code companion to learn how the algorithm works. 
Provide an explanation of the algorithm in your python file:
Example
Input:  [3, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]
Output: [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]
